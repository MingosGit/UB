a) How often do Whites win? With optimal KR vs KR play, checkmate is impossible, so the expected outcome is draw. At depth 4, White wins rarely; in typical tests, often 0 out of 10 runs (occasionally 1 if tie-breaking randomness leads Black into a short tactical miss).
b) Justification: KR vs KR is a theoretical draw with perfect play. With equal-depth minimax (limited horizon), neither side has a forced mate or stable material edge. The only way White wins is if the opponent blunders within the search horizon; otherwise games end in drawn positions or repetition.
